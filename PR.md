# Fix Game Logic and Improve Test Coverage

## Changes Made
1. Fixed core game logic in `src/gameLogic.js`:
   - Improved player switching mechanism
   - Fixed win and draw detection
   - Enhanced move validation
   - Added proper game state tracking
   - Simplified constructor and state management

2. Enhanced test coverage in `test/gameLogic.test.js`:
   - Added comprehensive test cases for all game scenarios
   - Fixed move sequences to create valid board states
   - Improved game state tracking tests
   - Added clear board state visualizations in comments

3. Improved property-based tests in `test/gameLogic.property.test.js`:
   - Updated test cases with valid move sequences
   - Enhanced boundary condition testing
   - Added more robust AI move validation

4. Added Jest configuration:
   - Created `jest.config.js` to properly separate unit tests from E2E tests
   - Configured test patterns to match unit and property-based tests
   - Excluded E2E tests from Jest runs

## Test Coverage
- All unit tests passing (17/17)
- All property-based tests passing
- E2E tests properly separated and run independently

## Key Improvements
1. **Game Logic**:
   - More reliable win detection
   - Proper handling of draw conditions
   - Consistent player switching
   - Better state management

2. **Testing**:
   - Clear test organization
   - Better test isolation
   - Improved readability with board state comments
   - Comprehensive edge case coverage

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Simplified code structure
   - Better error handling
   - Improved code comments
   - More maintainable test suite

## Testing Instructions
1. Run unit and property tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. Run E2E tests separately:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

## Future Improvements
1. Add more advanced AI strategies
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Add additional difficulty levels
4. Enhance error handling
